# Current status

~~This code is now able to take input for A, B, O and Pi and generate A', B' and Pi' for the given O.~~

~~This code is now able to take input for A, B, O and Pi and converge the model to an optimal one for each observation sequence.~~

This code is now able to train a model for the given words and recognize a single word spoken by an user.



## __Please add image display feature or youtube link feature for any given word.__
The code snippet should be able to use a ``` char * ``` and display some image or video related to it.
